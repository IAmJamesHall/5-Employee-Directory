This project contained an HTML & CSS framework. I fetched data from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) and displayed it on the page in a user-friendly way.

### Required Features
- Get & display 12 users from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me)
- when a user is clicked, show a modal window with more information
- add good code comments

### Extra Credit
- search
    - typing anywhere automatically focuses the search bar
- Next/Prev buttons to toggle back and forth between users in the modal window
- box shadow (implemented in `css/custom.css`)
- keyboard commands
    - arrow keys hit Next/Prev buttons in modal window
    - esc key exits modal window
